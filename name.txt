Rebase is a Git command that allows you to reapply the changes from one branch onto another. It is useful when you want to keep your branch history clean and linear, as it allows you to apply changes directly onto the branch you are currently working on, without creating merge commits. Rebase can be used both for local branches and remote branches, and it is a powerful tool for managing complex branching workflows.
